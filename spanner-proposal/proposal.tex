\section{Look at his face}
Just look at it. \\

\section{Emily's mental and spiritual health will be vastly improved}
A clearer mind leads to more focus in the kitchen.

\section{No financial burden on you!}
Emily will pay for the dog and all veterinary and dietary expenses.

\section{Protection on walks}
Especially after dark.

\section{He will go everywhere with Emily and sleep in her room}
So there is no imposition of a burden upon the greater household.

\section{Emily will henceforth clean ALL the faecal matter deposited by any, and indeed all dogs, residing at 2 Slade Avenue, Lindfield, NSW, 2070; weekly.}
Don't you just hate poo!

\section{He will be allowed to stay over at Hamish's house}
Not only allowed, but perhaps even gently encouraged.

\section{Emily is VERY responsible}
Spanner would be very polite and expertly trained - with the expert assistance of the man that brought you Enzo!

\section{Emily literally walks $>=$ 7.5km every single day}
Sometimes it gets lonely :(

\section*{The editors would like to note}
That initially this paper was slated to be a \textit{pros and cons} list, but unfortunately the authors, in their extensive research on this topic, were not able to find any negative aspects of this proposal.\\
